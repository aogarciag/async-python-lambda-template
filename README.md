## Setup

To run the scripts locally you'll need to install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) and configure your credentials. The `botocore` AWS client will read your credentials from the environment.

## Install

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Package

```
make all
```
